Recently I decided to give Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) another try.  Actually, it was when I wanted to set up Jekyll for this site.  I tried WSL on its initial release but didn't stick with it.  I was aware that it has steadily improved since then.

It's good enough.  The filesystem performance _feels_ slow.  I don't have hard numbers, but running `npm install` on the same project seems to take much longer on WSL than on a VirtualBox VM.

I wanted to try installing and running more stuff, but I also did not want to pollute my main WSL distro with random packages, services, and what have you.  That was when I found [LxRunOffline](https://github.com/DDoSolitary/LxRunOffline).

LxRunOffline allows its users to install multiple instances of a WSL Linux distro, and more importantly for my purpose, duplicate a distro installation.  (And much more!)

Now I have a base distro with zsh, [ZIM](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw), [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm), [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher), and ssh configuration ready to be duplicated whenever I feel like trying something.
